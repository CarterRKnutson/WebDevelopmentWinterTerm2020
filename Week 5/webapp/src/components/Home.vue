        <h2> This is the Simpsons</h2>
        <p>The Simpsons is an American animated sitcom created by Matt Groening for the Fox Broadcasting Company.
            The series is a satirical depiction of working-class life, epitomized by the Simpson family, which consists 
            of Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. The show is set in the fictional town of Springfield and parodies
             American culture and society, television, and the human condition. he family was conceived by Groening 
             shortly before a solicitation for a series of animated shorts with producer James L. Brooks. 
             Groening created a dysfunctional family and named the characters after his own family members, substituting 
             Bart for his own name. The shorts became a part of The Tracey Ullman Show on April 19, 1987.
              After three seasons, the sketch was developed into a half-hour prime time show and became 
              Fox's first series to land in the Top 30 ratings in a season (1989â€“90).

        <p>
            Since its debut on December 17, 1989, 673 episodes of The Simpsons have been broadcast.
             It is the longest-running American sitcom, and the longest-running American scripted primetime television 
             series, both in terms of seasons and number of episodes. The Simpsons Movie, a feature-length film, was 
             released in theaters worldwide on July 27, 2007, and grossed over $527 million. Then on October 30, 2007, 
             a video game was released. Currently, The Simpsons finished airing its thirtieth season, which began airing 
             September 30, 2018. The Simpsons was renewed for a thirty-first and thirty-second season on February 6, 
             2019, the latter of which will contain the 700th episode.[6] The Simpsons is a joint production by 
             Gracie Films and 20th Century Fox Television and syndicated by 20th Television.

        <h2> And This is more about the Simpsons </h2>
        <p>
            The Simpsons received acclaim throughout its first nine or ten seasons, which are generally 
            considered its "Golden Age". Time named it the 20th century's best television series, and Erik Adams of 
            The A.V. Club named it "television's crowning achievement regardless of format". On January 14, 2000, 
            the Simpson family was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. It has won dozens of awards since it 
            debuted as a series, including 34 Primetime Emmy Awards, 34 Annie Awards, and a Peabody Award. Homer's 
            exclamatory catchphrase "D'oh!" has been adopted into the English language, while The Simpsons has influenced 
            many other later adult-oriented animated sitcoms. However, it has also been criticized for a perceived decline 
            in quality over the years.
